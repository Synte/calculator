## The Odin Project

### Project: Calculator

Our final project is going to combine everything you’ve learned so far: you’re going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

#### Issues
+ Numbers have no thousands separator.
+ There is no character limit for the screen. Numbers get cut off on the right when too many are entered, resulting in being unable to see what has been entered beyond the first 20-21 characters.
